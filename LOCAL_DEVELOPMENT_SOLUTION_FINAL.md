# Local Development with CDK Pipeline

The error occurred because `CodePipelineSource.directory()` is no longer a valid method in AWS CDK Pipelines. For local development without GitHub, we should use `CodePipelineSource.code_pipeline_source()`.

The pipeline has been updated to use:
```python
input=cdk.pipelines.CodePipelineSource.code_pipeline_source(source_directory=".")
```

This configuration:
1. Works directly with local files
2. No Git repository required
3. No GitHub account needed
4. No CodeStar connections necessary
5. Simple local development workflow

To use this solution:

1. Make sure you have the latest AWS CDK installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g aws-cdk
   ```

2. Deploy your stack:
   ```bash
   cdk deploy
   ```

This solution:
- Maintains the pipeline functionality
- Works completely locally
- No external dependencies
- Simplest setup for local development

Note: Make sure you have proper AWS credentials configured in your environment for the deployment to work.
