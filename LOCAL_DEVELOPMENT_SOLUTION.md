# Local Development Solution

The error occurs because you're trying to set up a pipeline for local development. For local development without GitHub, it's recommended to use CDK in watch mode instead of setting up a pipeline.

Here's how to do local development:

1. Comment out or remove the pipeline code temporarily:
```python
# Comment out the pipeline code in cdk_app.py
# class AssetManagementPipeline(Stack):
#     def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
#         ...
```

2. Deploy directly using CDK CLI:
```bash
# Deploy your stack
cdk deploy

# Or use watch mode for development
cdk watch
```

The `cdk watch` command will:
- Monitor your local files for changes
- Automatically redeploy when changes are detected
- Provide immediate feedback on your changes
- Work without any repository setup

Benefits of this approach:
1. No need for pipeline setup
2. Faster development cycle
3. Works completely locally
4. No Git or GitHub requirements
5. Simpler configuration

When you're ready to set up CI/CD:
1. Uncomment the pipeline code
2. Set up your repository (GitHub or other provider)
3. Configure the appropriate CodePipelineSource

This is the recommended approach for local development with AWS CDK.
