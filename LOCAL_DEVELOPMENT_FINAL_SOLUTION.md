# Local Development Solution

The pipeline has been updated to use `NoSource` for local development. This approach:

1. Works entirely locally without any external dependencies
2. Doesn't require GitHub or any repository
3. Supports direct CDK deployments
4. No configuration needed

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the prerequisites:
```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Deploy your stack:
```bash
cdk deploy
```

Or use watch mode for development:
```bash
cdk watch
```

## How it Works

The `NoSource` configuration tells CDK that we're working purely locally and don't need any external source integration. This is perfect for:
- Local development
- Testing changes
- Quick iterations
- Development without version control

When you're ready to set up proper CI/CD later, you can replace `NoSource()` with:
- `CodePipelineSource.gitHub()` for GitHub
- `CodePipelineSource.connection()` for other Git providers
