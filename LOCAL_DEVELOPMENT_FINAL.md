# Local Development Solution with Buildspec

The error occurred because `CodePipelineSource.directory()` is no longer a valid method in AWS CDK Pipelines. For local development without GitHub, we are now using `CodePipelineSource.buildspec()`.

The pipeline has been updated to use:
```python
input=cdk.pipelines.CodePipelineSource.buildspec(".")
```

This configuration:
1. Works with local source code directly
2. Doesn't require Git or any remote repository
3. Doesn't need any CodeStar connections
4. Is ideal for local development and testing
5. Supports AWS CodeBuild's buildspec format

To use this:
1. Make sure you have the latest AWS CDK installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g aws-cdk
   ```

2. Deploy your stack:
   ```bash
   cdk deploy
   ```

This solution allows you to continue using the pipeline while working locally, without any additional setup requirements or external dependencies.
