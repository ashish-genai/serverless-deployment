# Local Source Pipeline Update

The error occurred because `CodePipelineSource.directory()` is no longer a valid method in AWS CDK Pipelines. For local development, we should use `CodePipelineSource.git_hub_connection()` instead.

The pipeline has been updated to use:
```python
input=cdk.pipelines.CodePipelineSource.git_hub_connection(".", branch="main")
```

This configuration will:
1. Work with your local Git repository
2. Does not require hosting on GitHub
3. Uses the local directory as the source
4. Supports branch specification for deployment

Requirements:
1. Make sure you have initialized your directory as a Git repository (`git init`)
2. Have at least one commit in your repository
3. Have the latest version of AWS CDK installed

Note: This approach uses Git for source control but doesn't require a remote repository.
