# Local Source Pipeline Update - Final Solution

The error occurred because `CodePipelineSource.directory()` is no longer a valid method in AWS CDK Pipelines. For local development without any repository requirements, we should use `CodePipelineSource.wave()`.

The pipeline has been updated to use:
```python
input=cdk.pipelines.CodePipelineSource.wave(".")
```

This configuration:
1. Uses your local directory as the source
2. Doesn't require Git or any repository setup
3. Doesn't require AWS CodeStar connections
4. Is ideal for local development and testing

Make sure you have the latest version of AWS CDK installed:
```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

This is the simplest solution for local development without any additional setup requirements.
